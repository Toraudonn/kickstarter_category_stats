## kickstarter_category_stats
Web scraper that scrapes category statistics from [kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) implimented with `scrapy` on python2.7.  
  
Each day, kickstater updates the [stats page](https://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats?ref=footer) that includes statistics for each categories (such as games, crafts, and music).  
What I did was make the data easy to use by putting those statistics in csv format.  
Also, I automated the whole process, so that people could get those data easily with just a single command!
  
If you're familiar with `scrapy`, then you'll have no touble shooting this one up, but if not, you should follow the tutorial [here](https://scrapy.org/).
